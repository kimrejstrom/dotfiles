# ui = true is a superset of all the more specific color options
#  as documented at http://book.git-scm.com/5_customizing_git.html
# When set to always, always use colors in all git commands which are capable of colored output.
# When false, never. When set to true or auto, use colors only when the output is to the terminal.
# When more specific variables of color.* are set, they always take precedence over this setting.
# Defaults to false.
